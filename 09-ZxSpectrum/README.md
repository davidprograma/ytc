# 09 - ZX Spectrum

This repository subdirectory hosts emulated versions of two simple games I made for the ZX Spectrum 48k.

They have their own repos:
* [Snake for ZX Spectrum GitHub repository](https://github.com/dcrespo3d/zx-spectrum-snake)
* [Tetris for ZX Spectrum GitHub repository](https://github.com/dcrespo3d/zx-spectrum-tetris)

First, I integrated the [JSSpeccy](https://jsspeccy.zxdemo.org/) emulator by Matt Westcott.

Here are the links for both games using the JSSpeccy emulator:

* [Snake for ZX Spectrum running on JSSpeccy](https://davidprograma.github.io/ytc/09-ZxSpectrum/zxsnake.html)
* [Tetris for ZX Spectrum running on JSSpeccy](https://davidprograma.github.io/ytc/09-ZxSpectrum/zxtetris.html)

Then, I added emulated soft keys for mobile (the emulator expects _real_ keyboard presses). I have provided soft keys for all keys used in these games.

It works correctly on computers, but it is a bit laggy on mobile devices.

Later, I integrated the excellent [QAOP](http://torinak.com/qaop) emulator by Jan Bobrowski.

Here are the links for both games using the QAOP emulator:

* [Snake for ZX Spectrum running on QAOP](https://davidprograma.github.io/ytc/09-ZxSpectrum/snake.html)
* [Tetris for ZX Spectrum running on QAOP](https://davidprograma.github.io/ytc/09-ZxSpectrum/tetris.html)

The timing is much more precise and it appears to be no lag on my test devices.
